# Congress Sentiment Analysis Final Project

## Introduction
This project involves a sophisticated script that performs sentiment analysis on the Congressional Record's text, followed by the creation of insightful visualizations. The primary objective is to examine whether sentiment analysis can predict periods of heightened conflict, like the Civil War, by analyzing historical congressional data.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For scripting and analysis.
- **SciPy & NumPy**: Used for complex mathematical operations and data handling.
- **Hugging Face**: Leveraged for advanced sentiment analysis capabilities.
- **Insight**: Our analysis revealed a moderate correlation between sentiment in congressional records and periods of historical unrest.

## Features
- **Sentiment Tracking**: Analysis of sentiment trends over time in congressional records.
- **Conflict Prediction**: Exploration of the potential to predict historical conflicts using sentiment data.
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive visual representation of sentiment trends and their correlation with historical events.

## Installation
1. Set up a Python environment.
2. Install necessary modules: `pip install jupyter scipy numpy huggingface`.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.

## Usage
- **Current Status**: The script is not operational at the moment due to the lack of access to a requisite congressional record dataset.
- **Functionality**: When operational, sentiment_analysis.ipynb processes the Congressional Record to output a yearly sentiment analysis CSV. Then, visualization.ipynb is used to generate various visual representations of this data.

## Architecture
The project utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for a streamlined and interactive analysis process, encompassing data processing, sentiment analysis, and visualization steps.
